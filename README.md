# Dynamic Tutorial Sheet App
Very simple proof of concept - dynamically generates an online tutorial sheet web application using data from the `src/TutorialSheet.json` file. This is to simulate the response from an API call made to some backend that would store all the data on all the tutorial sheets.

*(this is my first time using Vue, so I've probably committed every single bad practice there is)*
